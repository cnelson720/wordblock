simple word finding game

Rules:
  game begins when you hit start
  you have 60 seconds to create as many words with a random set of 16 letters. Each letter in the word you enter is worth 1 point.
  you cannot enter words you have already entered.
  it will also count how many words you have found.
  
  if you are trying to enter a word and it isn't giving you any points, then its not considered a word.
  
  I have a list of english words in words.json
  
Next update i want to try and add a list of words found and not just a ticker of how many
